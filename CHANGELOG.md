## [2.0.0]

See the [migration guide](migration.md) for help migrating from version 1 to version 2.

### Breaking Changes
 - Minimum PHP version required is now 8.1
 - JustDate, JustTime, DateRange constructors are now protected methods, so you can't directly call `new JustDate()` - use `JustDate::make` or `JustTime::make` or `DateRange::make` instead.
 - Changes to serialize/unserialize mechanism - you cannot unserialize using v2 from strings serialized using v1.  None of the classes now implement the `/Serializable` interface (so do not have the `serialize()` `unserialize()` methods), instead the new `__serialize()` and `__unserialize()` magic methods (introduced in PHP7.4) are now used.
 - `JustDate::spanDays()` renamed to `JustDate::difference()`.
 - Removed `DateRange::span` and `DateRange::num_nights` (use `DateRange::inner_length` instead).
 - Removed `DateRange::num_days` (use `DateRange::outer_length` instead).
 - Serialization of all classes has changed
 - Renamed `DateRange::eachExceptEnd` to `DateRange::eachExceptLast`
 - Renamed `DateRange::iterateSubRanges` to `DateRange::eachSubRange` and changed the way options are passed to this method
 - Changed behaviour of `MutableDateSet::subtract` - now returns a new object instead of mutating the original
 - JustDate property `$day_of_week` now returns an instance of the `DayOfWeek` enum instead of an integer (get the integer with `$date->day_of_week->value`)

### Added
 - Added `epoch_day` property to JustDate and static `JustDate::fromEpochDay()` function.
 - Added `subDays()`, `subWeeks()`, `subMonths()` and `subYears()` functions to JustDate as alternatives to using a negative quantity in
the old `addDays()`, `addWeeks()`, `addMonths()` and `addYears()` methods.
 - Added `toDateTime()` method to JustDate.
 - Added `addDaysPassingTest()` and `addWorkingDays()` methods to JustDate.
 - Added `fromStartAndInnerLength` and `fromStartAndOuterLength` static methods to DateRange.
 - All iterator methods can now be run in reverse by supplying the `backwards: true` argument.
 - Added `remove()` method to MutableDateSet (which has previous mutating behaviour of `subtract()` method).

### Changed
 - Internally JustDate is based on the integer 'epoch_day' (the number of days since the Unix Epoch), instead of a native PHP DateTime object.  This should improve speed and efficiency in most situations.
